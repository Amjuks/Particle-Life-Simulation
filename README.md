# Particle Life Simulation

A fun and interactive particle life simulation built with plain JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Watch colorful particles interact, move, and evolve dynamically in your browser.

Live Demo: [https://amjuks.github.io/Particle-Life-Simulation/](https://amjuks.github.io/Particle-Life-Simulation/)

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation:** Particles interact based on customizable physics parameters.
- **Real-time Controls:** Use the on-screen control panel to adjust parameters such as particle count, interaction ranges, and noise strength.
- **Responsive Design:** The simulation adjusts to your browser window size.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amjuks/Particle-Life-Simulation.git
   cd Particle-Life-Simulation
   ```

2. **Open the Simulation:**

   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can simply double-click the file or use a live server extension in your code editor.

## Usage

- **Simulation:**  
  The particles will react immediately to parameter changes. Enjoy watching the emergent behavior and experiment with different settings!
